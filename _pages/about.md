I'm Hoa Vo, currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the American University. 

My research interests are in applied microeconomics, at the intersection of labor, health, household, and public economics, with research focus on decision-making and bargaining power dynamics. Trained in quantitative economics and econometrics, causal inference methods for impact evaluation (including policy impact), machine learning and AI.  
Previously, I worked for UN-ECLAC to produce a report on the U.S. new industrial policy (with focus on clean and renewable energy), and also worked as a Consultant in the private sector. 

I hold a bachelor's degree in Finance from University of Wisconsin, and earned my M.A. in Economics from Andrew Young School of Policy Studies (AYSPS) - Georgia State University. 

I am available for interviews during the 2025-2026 job market season. Please feel free to reach out via my email.
